# About Me


My name is John Wakahiu. 
I currently work as a Software Test Engineer at Microsoft Testing Center. 
I am mostly using virtualization technologies such as Hyper V and Powershell Scripting.

I do not create websites. I create experiences. 
I create life, joy, happiness.
Humanity - a better place on the planet.

I believe in doing something awesome. 
No matter what the project or task is, it is better to do it right.
The perfect project is not just completed. It is done awesomely.

That's me, I keep things awesome. This saves you time and money
